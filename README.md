# AI-projects
This repository contains a collection of AI and machine learning projects, including data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Each project is organized in its own folder and includes code, notebooks, and documentation.

## Project: Student Performance Prediction
This project analyzes factors affecting student exam scores using regression models. It demonstrates data preprocessing, outlier removal, feature engineering, and model comparison (linear and polynomial regression).

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Outlier detection and removal
Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Regression modeling (Linear & Polynomial)
Model evaluation with error metrics
Files
student_per.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook for the student performance analysis
Data files (CSV) used for training and testing models
Supporting scripts and functions
Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Dataset
The project uses the Student Performance Factors dataset from Kaggle. link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors

## Forest Cover Type Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict forest cover types based on cartographic variables. The dataset includes features such as elevation, soil type, and wilderness area, and the goal is to classify the type of forest cover present.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis and visualization
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.)
Performance metrics and comparison

Files
forest_model.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, modeling, and results
Data files (CSV) used for training and testing models
Supporting scripts and utility functions

Dataset
The project uses the Forest CoverType dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype
